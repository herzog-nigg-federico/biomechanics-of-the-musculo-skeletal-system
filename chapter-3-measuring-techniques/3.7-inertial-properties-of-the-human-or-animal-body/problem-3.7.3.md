# Problem 3.7.3

Using the shank and the leg (with $$\bold{I_s}$$, $$\bold{I_t}$$, $$m_s$$, and $$m_t$$ known and a knee angle of $$90Ã—$$) determine:&#x20;

(a) the location of the centre of mass, CM.&#x20;

(b) the moment of inertia about the centre of mass, CM.

(c) the moment of inertia about the ankle joint.
