# Problem 3.7.1

(a) Write the general form of a matrix of moment of inertia about the centre of mass of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. Provide the mathematical definition of each of the items in the matrix.

(b) Write the general form of a matrix of moment of inertia if the local coordinate system is chosen to be the principle axes of the rigid body.
