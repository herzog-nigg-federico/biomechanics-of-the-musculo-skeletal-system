# Problem 3.7.2

A shank and a leg are schematically illustrated in the planar Figure 3.7.1. The moment of inertia of the shank about its centre of mass is $$\bold{I_s}$$, and the moment of inertia of the thigh about its centre of mass is $$\bold{I_t}$$. Determine the moment of inertia of the entire leg about the hip joint.
