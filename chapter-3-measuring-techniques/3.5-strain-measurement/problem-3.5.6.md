# Problem 3.5.6

In a $$60\times$$ strain gauge rosette, the following extensional strains are measured:

$$\qquad \varepsilon_0=+600 \space \mu \varepsilon$$

$$\qquad \varepsilon_{60}=-360 \space \mu \varepsilon$$​

$$\qquad \varepsilon_{120}=+300 \space \mu \varepsilon$$​

Determine the principal strains and maximum shear strain. This problem can be solved graphically using Mohr’s circle or analytically.
