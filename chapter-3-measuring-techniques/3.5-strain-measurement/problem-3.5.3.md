description: Bulk modulus as a function of Poisson's ration and the elastic modulus.

# Problem 3.5.3

Poisson’s ratio is the ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain when a material is loaded uniaxially.

$$ε_{lat}=-νε_{long}$$

​If the Elastic (Young’s) modulus relating uniaxial stress to uniaxial strain is $$E$$, where $$σ=Εε$$, show that the bulk modulus, relating volumetric strain to hydrostatic stress, $$Κ=\frac E {3(1-2ν)}$$.
