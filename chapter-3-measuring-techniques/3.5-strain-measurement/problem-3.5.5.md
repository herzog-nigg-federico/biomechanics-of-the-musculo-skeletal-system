# Problem 3.5.5

In a $$45\times$$ strain gauge rosette, the following extensional strains are measured:

$$\qquad \varepsilon_0=475 \space \mu \varepsilon$$​

$$\qquad \varepsilon_{45}=-225 \space \mu \varepsilon$$​

$$\qquad \varepsilon_{90}=-325 \space \mu \varepsilon$$​

Determine the principal strains and maximum shear strain. This problem can be solved graphically using Mohr’s circle or analytically.
