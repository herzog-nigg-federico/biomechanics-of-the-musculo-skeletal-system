# Problem 3.2.2

A person is standing still on a force plate with dimensions as illustrated in Figure 3.2.1. The distances between the centres of the force sensors are $$0.6m$$ and $$0.9m$$. The forces measured in the four corners are $$\bold{F_1}=100 \space N$$, $$\bold{F_1}=250 \space N$$, $$\bold{F_3}=350 \space N$$, and $$\bold{F_4}=200 \space N$$.

(a) Determine the centre of pressure.

(b) Comment on the force distribution on the two illustrated feet, and explain where the forces are high and where they are low.
