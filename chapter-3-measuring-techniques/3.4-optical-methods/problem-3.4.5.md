# Problem 3.4.5

The velocity of a marker has been determined from film and video information. Estimate the error of the calculated velocity.&#x20;

#### Assumptions

1. The marker position was digitized with an accuracy of $$0.5 \space mm$$.&#x20;
2. The distance between two positions of the marker is $$1 \space cm$$.
3. The time interval between two frames is accurate to $$0.001 \space s$$.
4. The time interval between two frames is $$0.01 \space s$$.
