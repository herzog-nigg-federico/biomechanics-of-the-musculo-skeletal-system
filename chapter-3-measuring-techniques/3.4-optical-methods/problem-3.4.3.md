# Problem 3.4.3

The calculated results of angular displacements depend, among other factors, on the chosen sequence of axes of rotation. List the sequence of rotation axes that allows the use of the definitions for flexion-extension, ab-adduction, and in-eversion for the knee joint, and provide the justification for the selected sequence from the anatomical definitions.
