# Problem 3.4.4

(a) Write the rotation matrices for rotations about the $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z$$ axes of a Cartesian coordinate system.

(b) Determine the parametric rotation matrix for Euler angles in the sequence $$z$$, $$x$$, and $$z$$.&#x20;

(c) Determine the parametric rotation matrix for Cardan angles in the sequence $$z$$, $$x$$, and $$y$$.
