---

# Problem 3.1.3

(a) Draw a Wheatstone bridge circuitry for a situation where two force transducers are used to determine the acting force in a strain gauge setting.&#x20;

(b) Write and solve the equations for the Wheatstone bridge for this example.

(c) Explain how results can be used to determine the force in a structure.
