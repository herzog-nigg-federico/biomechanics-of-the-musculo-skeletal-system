# Problem 3.3.5

A steel shot with an attached accelerometer is to be used in a surface drop test experiment. Draw the acceleration-time diagrams seen by the accelerometers, with the upward acceleration being positive for the following two cases:&#x20;

(a) The shot lands and does not bounce off the surface.&#x20;

(b) The shot bounces off the surface (draw the acceleration curve until the time the shot contacts the surface the second time).
