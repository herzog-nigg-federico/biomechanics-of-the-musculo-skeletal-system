# Problem 3.3.9 (advanced)

When discussing acceleration results, two variables are often used (the amplitude of the acceleration and the peak-to-peak amplitude of the acceleration). Discuss these two variables with respect to their mechanical and/or biological appropriateness. Specifically, do both variables have a sound mechanical and/or biological and physical meaning?
