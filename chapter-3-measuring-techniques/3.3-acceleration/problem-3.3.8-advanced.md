description: Interpretation of acceleration measurements during running.

# Problem 3.3.8 (advanced)

Axial acceleration of the tibia has been quantified during heel-toe running for two sport shoe conditions (soft and hard). The axial acceleration amplitudes for the soft sole condition were $$15\space g$$, and axial acceleration amplitudes for the hard soled shoe were $$20\space g$$. Discuss the possible interpretation of these results with respect to internal loading at the ankle joint.&#x20;

#### Assumptions

1. The accelerometers were strapped tightly to the tibia.
2. The maximal amplitudes were recorded in the first $$15$$ milliseconds after heel strike.
