# Problem 3.3.7

A vertical ground reaction force has been measured as illustrated in Figure 3.3.2.&#x20;

(a) Determine the time point(s) in this diagram for which the velocity of the CM is zero.&#x20;

(b) Determine the time intervals in this diagram for which the velocity of the CM is negative.&#x20;

(c) Determine the time intervals in this diagram for which the velocity of the CM is positive.&#x20;

(d) Determine the time point(s) in this diagram for which the acceleration of the CM is zero.&#x20;

(e) Determine the time intervals in this diagram for which the acceleration of the CM is negative.&#x20;

(f) Determine the time intervals in this diagram for which the acceleration of the CM is positive.&#x20;

(g) Determine the time point(s) in this diagram for which the CM reaches its minimal height.&#x20;

(h) Describe the movement executed by the subject.
