# Problem 3.3.3

Acceleration measurements from bone and skin-mounted acceleration sensors typically provide different results.&#x20;

(a) Discuss the differences between acceleration results determined from bone or skin-mounted accelerometers.&#x20;

(b) Discuss the major reasons for these differences.&#x20;

(c) Which acceleration is needed to determine the ground reaction force with the help of inverse dynamics (top to bottom approach) â€“ skin-mounted, bone-mounted, or other acceleration? Explain and provide the reason.
