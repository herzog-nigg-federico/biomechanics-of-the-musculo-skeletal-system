# Problem 3.3.6

The movement of a segment (Figure 3.3.1) is confined to the $$x-y$$ plane. Two accelerometers are mounted firmly to the segment. The accelerometer on the left end of the segment (point A) measures acceleration in the direction indicated with an amplitude of $$a_1=10\sdot\sqrt{2} \space m\sdot s^2$$. The accelerometer at the right end of the segment (point B) measures an acceleration of $$a_2=0\space m\sdot s^2$$.

(a) Determine the linear acceleration of the centre of mass, CM.&#x20;

(b) Determine the angular velocity of the CM at the time $$t=1\space s$$.&#x20;

(c) Determine the angular acceleration of the CM.

#### Assumptions

1. Gravity can be neglected.
2. The limb segment is rigid.
3. The connection between the accelerometers and limb segment is rigid.
