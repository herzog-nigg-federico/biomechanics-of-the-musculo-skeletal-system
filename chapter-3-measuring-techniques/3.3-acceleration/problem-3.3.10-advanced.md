# Problem 3.3.10 (advanced)

Assume that you have measured acceleration at the tibia with the help of skin-mounted accelerometers. The result of one trial is illustrated in Figure 3.3.3 (accelerometer 1). Discuss this result critically, identify possible problems, and accept or reject the derived results for further use.
