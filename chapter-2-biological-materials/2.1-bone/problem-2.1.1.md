# Problem 2.1.1

A hypothetical uniaxial compression test was performed on a machined cylinder of human femoral cortical bone, and the results of the force-displacement measurements are shown in Figure 2.1.1. Estimate the elastic modulus ($$E$$) and the ultimate strength ($$\sigma_{u}$$) of this sample of bone.

#### Assumptions

1. The bone tissue is homogeneous and isotropic.&#x20;
2. The question can be treated as a one-dimensional proble.
