description: Bending stress for a hollow circle.
---

# Problem 2.1.14 (advanced)

Given:

* Stress due to bending       $$σ_{be} = M_{be}⋅ \frac{y} {I_{xx}}$$
* Moment of inertia              $$I_{xx}=\int_Ay^2dA$$

Show that the bending stress for a hollow circle is $$σ_{be} = \frac{4⋅M_{be}⋅R}{ \pi (R^4 - r^4)}$$
