description: Stress distribution at tibia during running.

# Problem 2.1.12 (advanced)

Estimate the stress distribution in a cross-section in the middle of the tibia during heel-toe running for the indicated time points, using an estimated centre of pressure of the resultant ground reaction force based on Figure 2.1.7.

#### Assumptions

1. The ankle joint complex is stiff.
2. The bone material is isotropic and homogeneous.
3. The ground reaction forces act (contrary to the illustration) parallel to the tibia.&#x20;
4. Muscle forces can be neglected.
5. The cross-section of the tibia is circular (with a radius of $$2 \space  cm$$) and completely filled with material.
6. Other assumptions that allow you to solve this question with a reasonable amount of work.
