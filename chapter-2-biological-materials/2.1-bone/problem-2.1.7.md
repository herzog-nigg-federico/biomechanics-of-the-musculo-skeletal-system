# Problem 2.1.7

A cylindrical bone (illustrated in Figure 2.1.6) has the outer radius, $$R$$, and the inner radius, $$r$$. Determine analytically and graphically the maximal compression stress, $$Ïƒ_{comp}$$, at a cross-section C-D as a function of the relative wall thickness $$[(R-r):R]$$ for different wall thickness.&#x20;

#### Assumptions

1. The structure is cylindrical.
2. The outer radius is $$R = 3 \space cm$$.
3. The force acts parallel to the symmetry axis at the edge of the cylindrical structure and has a magnitude of $$F = 1000 \space N$$.
4. The structure is firmly anchored in the ground.&#x20;
5. The length-width ratio of the structure is large.
