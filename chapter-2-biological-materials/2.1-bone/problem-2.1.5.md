  Muscle force required for minimisation of local compression tension stress at
  femur.

# Problem 2.1.5

A contact force is acting at point E on the drawing (Figure 2.1.4), representing the head of the femur of a human leg. Determine the magnitude and direction of additional muscle force acting at point A to minimize the magnitude of the local compression or tension stress in the point C or D. Discuss the solution with respect to human anatomy, and identify a muscle that corresponds to the proposed solution.

#### Assumptions

1. The length-width ratio of the structure is large.
2. The femur is a homogeneous and isotropic structure.
3. The shear influence is neglected (Bernoulli bending theory).

Remember that muscle forces pull, but do not push.
