# Problem 2.1.15 (advanced)

It has been suggested that impact forces acting on the locomotor system can have a positive effect on bone mass and bone mineral density in adolescents and adults. It has also been suggested that bone mass and bone mineral density may be increased with a weight bearing exercise regime in postmenopausal women. Investigate and discuss the supporting evidence for these claims.
