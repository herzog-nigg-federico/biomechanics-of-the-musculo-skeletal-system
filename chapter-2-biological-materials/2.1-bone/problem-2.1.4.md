# Problem 2.1.4

Draw the force-deformation and stress-strain diagrams and determine the slopes for the listed cylindrical cross-sectional structures.&#x20;

| Cylinder | Radius | Elastic Modulus | Height of Cylinder |
| :------: | :----: | :-------------: | :----------------: |
|     A    |    r   |        E        |          h         |
|     B    |   2r   |        E        |          h         |
|     C    |    r   |        2E       |         2h         |
|     D    |   2r   |        2E       |         2h         |

#### Assumptions

1. The force-deformation and stress-strain relationships are linear.
2. The force acts parallel to the symmetry axis.
