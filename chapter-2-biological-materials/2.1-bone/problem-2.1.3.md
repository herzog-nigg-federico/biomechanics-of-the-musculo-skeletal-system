# Problem 2.1.3

A force of $$4000 \space N$$ acts at a distance $$60 \space mm$$ from the axis of the structure where we consider several idealized bone cross-sectional areas as illustrated (Figure 2.1.3). Determine the moment of inertia and the maximum bending stress for each section. The inner and outer radii for each section are given as follows:&#x20;

| Cross-section | Inner Radius (mm) | Outer Radius (mm) |                 Description                 |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|       A       |         20        |         25        |                  Base case                  |
|       B       |         15        |         20        |    Smaller diameter; same wall thickness    |
|       C       |         25        |         30        |     Larger diameter; same wall thickness    |
|       D       |         20        |        28.3       | Periosteal thickening relative to base case |
|       E       |         15        |         25        |  Endosteal thickening relative to base case |

#### Assumptions

1. The weight of the bone can be neglected.&#x20;
2. The bone tissue is homogeneous and isotropic.&#x20;
3. The problem can be treated two-dimensionally.
