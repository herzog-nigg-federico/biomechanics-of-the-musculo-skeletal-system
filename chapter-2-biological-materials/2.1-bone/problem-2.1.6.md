# Problem 2.1.6

The two free body diagrams in Figure 2.1.5 are equivalent. Knowing that the contact force, $$\bold{F_C}$$, and the contact moment, $$\bold{M_C}$$, are the same for both diagrams, use the equations that govern each system to show that $$\bold{F_A} = \bold{F_B}$$ , and calculate $$\bold{M_B}$$.&#x20;
