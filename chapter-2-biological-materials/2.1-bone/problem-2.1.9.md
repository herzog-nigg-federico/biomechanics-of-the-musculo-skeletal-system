description: Bone evolution and resistance to compressive and tensile forces.

# Problem 2.1.9

It has been stated that bone is stronger in response to compressive forces than in response to tensile forces. It has been argued that this may be due to an evolutionary adaptation. Based on the actual loading pattern, is it reasonable to assume that all bones in the human body have evolved to be stronger in compression than in tension. Provide evidence to support this statement.
