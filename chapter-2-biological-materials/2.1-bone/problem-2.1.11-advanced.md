# Problem 2.1.11 (advanced)

Determine the stress distribution for the firmly anchored structure illustrated in Figure 2.1.7. Specifically, determine the location of the neutral axis, the areas with compression and the areas with tension, and indicate where compression or tension stresses are low or high.

#### Assumptions

1. The structure is homogeneous.
2. A general force acts with the components: $$\bold{F} = (-314 N, -628 N, 0 N)$$.
3. The information provided does not allow determining the stress in some boundary areas. Therefore, neglect those areas.
