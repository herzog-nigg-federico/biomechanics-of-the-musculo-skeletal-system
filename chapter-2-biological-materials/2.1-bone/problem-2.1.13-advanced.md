# Problem 2.1.13 (advanced)

Given a hollow cylindrical bone with a constant wall thickness, $$d$$, and a variable outside radius, $$r(x)$$, where $$r(0) = r_o$$, and a moment, $$M$$, applied at $$x=0$$ (Figure 2.1.8). How must $$r$$ vary as a function of $$x$$ so that the maximal tensile strength at any point along the bone is constant?
