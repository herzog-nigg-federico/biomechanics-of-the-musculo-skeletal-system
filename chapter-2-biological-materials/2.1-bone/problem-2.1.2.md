# Problem 2.1.2

A mouse femur has the shape shown in Figure 2.1.2, as measured using high-resolution computed tomography at an isotropic resolution of $$0.0322 mm$$, i.e., same resolution in all three dimensions. Given the loading configuration shown with $$F = 15 N$$, determine the normal stress in the bone at the section a-a’ of the mid diaphysis.

#### Assumptions

1. The weight of the bone can be neglected.&#x20;
2. The bone tissue is homogeneous and isotropic.&#x20;
3. The problem can be treated two-dimensionally.
