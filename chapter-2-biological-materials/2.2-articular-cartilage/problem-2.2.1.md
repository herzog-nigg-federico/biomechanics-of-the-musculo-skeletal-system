# Problem 2.2.1

(a) Estimate the forces in the ankle joint while standing on the toes of one foot using a free body diagram.&#x20;

#### Assumptions

1. The horizontal distance from the point of contact to the ankle joint is $$25 \space cm$$.
2. The horizontal distance from the ankle joint to the Achilles tendon is $$5 \space cm$$.
3. The subject has a mass of $$100 \space kg$$.
4. All forces act in vertical direction.

(b) Estimate the average normal stress in the ankle joint if the idealized contact area is flat and has an area of $$5  \space cm^2$$.

(c) Compare and discuss the results of the findings in _Question 2_ with the ultimate compressive stress values published by Yamada (1973).
