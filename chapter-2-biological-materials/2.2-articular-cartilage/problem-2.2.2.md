# Problem 2.2.2

The idealized tensile stressâ€“strain behaviours for the surface and the deepest layer of cartilage are illustrated in Figure 2.2.1.

(a) Calculate the modulus of elasticity for the two layers.

(b) Determine the strain in each of the two layers if a tensile force of $$10000 \space N$$ acts on a piece of cartilage that has a flat area of $$10  \space cm^2$$.
