# Problem 2.3.2

Determine the DOF for a piston in a three-dimensional space (Figure 2.3.1, centre).&#x20;

#### Assumptions

1. The upper segment of the piston is fixed with a (non-sliding) hinge joint to a rigid structure.&#x20;
2. The joint between the two segments is a (non-sliding) hinge joint.
