# Problem 4.1.2

Draw the FBD for the foot of a person standing on the forefoot of one leg.

System of interest: Foot.

#### Assumptions

1. The foot is a rigid structure.&#x20;
2. The foot has one idealized joint, the ankle joint, which is responsible for plantar- and dorsi-flexion between foot and leg. The foot does not perform any in-eversion or ab-adduction movements, or both.&#x20;
3. The structures responsible for contact forces in this specific example are the Achilles tendon, the tibia at the ankle joint, the rigid foot at the ankle joint, and the ground.&#x20;
4. There is no friction in the ankle joint.&#x20;
5. The weight of the foot can be neglected.&#x20;
6. The problem can be solved two dimensionally.
