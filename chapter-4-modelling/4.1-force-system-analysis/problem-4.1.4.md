# Problem 4.1.4

Perform a force system analysis using vector notation, including definition of the system of interest, assumptions, free body diagram, equations of motion, and solution to determine the forces in the human body for the following conditions:

(a) Force in the Achilles tendon for a person ($$m=70\space kg$$) standing on the toes of one leg (static). (b) Force in the tibialis anterior muscle during landing in heel-toe running using the data from Figure 4.1.1 (dynamic).

(c) Force in the elbow joint for a person holding a mass of $$10\space kg$$ in the hand assuming that the force of the biceps acts vertically and for the geometrical values indicated in Figure 4.9.4 (static).
