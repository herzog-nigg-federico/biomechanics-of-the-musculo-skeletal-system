# Problem 4.1.1

Draw the free body diagram (FBD) for the foot of a person standing on the forefoot of one leg.

System of interest: Foot.

#### Assumptions

1. The foot is a rigid structure.&#x20;
2. The foot has one idealized joint, the ankle joint, which is responsible for plantar- and dorsi-flexion between foot and leg.&#x20;
3. The structures responsible for contact forces are the Achilles tendon, the tibia at the ankle joint, and the ground.&#x20;
4. There is no friction in the ankle joint.
5. The weight of the foot can be neglected.&#x20;
6. The problem can be solved two dimensionally.
