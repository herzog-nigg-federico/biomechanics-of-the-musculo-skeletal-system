# Problem 4.2.6

Determine the mechanical characteristics of a simplistic muscle model, including a contractile element, a spring, and a damper.

#### Assumptions

1. The muscle mass can be concentrated in one particle.&#x20;
2. The mechanical properties of a muscle, which are typically distributed over the whole muscle, can be separated and modelled independently.&#x20;
3. The elasticity of the considered muscle is assumed to be constant. Consequently, a simple linear spring can be used.&#x20;
4. The damping behaviour of the considered muscle is assumed to be constant. Consequently, a simple damper can be used.&#x20;
5. The muscle can be represented with a spring on one side of the mass and a damper in parallel with a contractile element on the other side of the mass.&#x20;
6.  The internal force produced by the contractile element will change from zero to its maximal value immediately at the time $$t=0$$.

    This means:

    $$\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F(t)=\begin{cases}    0 &\text{for } t<0 \\    F_{max} &\text{for } t\ge 0 \end{cases}$$​
7.  Symbols:

    $$\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad t \qquad \text{ \space :time}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad m \qquad \text{:muscle mass}\\\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad k \qquad \text{\space :spring constant}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad r \qquad \text{ \space :coefficient of viscous damping} \\\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad x(t) \quad \text{ :position of muscle mass (particle)}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F(t) \quad \text{:internal force produced by the contractile element}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad K(t) \quad \text{:external force at muscle insertion, } P(A)$$
8. The forces are drawn in the positive axis direction.​

The FBD (Free Body Diagram) and an illustration of the situation are shown in Figure 4.2.3.
