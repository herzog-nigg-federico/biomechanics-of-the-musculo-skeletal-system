# Problem 4.2.2

Describe the one-dimensional movement of a particle upon which a constant force is acting.

#### Assumptions

1.  A constant force, $$F$$, is acting on the particle in vertical ($$y$$) direction:&#x20;

    â€‹$$\qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F=mg \newline \text{where: \qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad} g=9.81 \space m/s^2$$
2. The mass can be considered as a particle.&#x20;
3. Air resistance can be neglected.&#x20;
4. All forces are drawn in a positive axis direction.
