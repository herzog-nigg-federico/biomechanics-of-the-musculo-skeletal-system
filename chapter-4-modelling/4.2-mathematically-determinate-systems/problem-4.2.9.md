# Problem 4.2.9

Determine the influence of the elastic and viscous elements that cushion the ground contact on the energy demands of a runner.

#### Assumptions

1. The human body is subdivided into two masses. One mass, $$m_1$$, represents the foot of the support leg. The other mass, $$m$$, represents the rest of the body (Figure 4.2.7). This second mass, $$m$$, is called the upper body in the following.
2. The effects of all the extremities except the support leg on the upper body are neglected.&#x20;
3. The horizontal velocity of the upper body is assumed to be constant. The model neglects its movement in the horizontal direction, considering only its vertical movement. The model is, therefore, one-dimensional.&#x20;
4. A spring-damper combination, $$k$$, $$kk$$, and $$c$$, represents the combined material properties of the surface, the shoe midsole, and the human heel.&#x20;
5. The surface is assumed to be rigid.&#x20;
6. A force, $$F$$, acts between the upper body and the foot.&#x20;
7. A force, $$F_G$$ (ground reaction force), acts between the rigid ground and the lower end of the spring-damper combination.&#x20;
8. During the flight phase, the runnerâ€™s body moves freely in the conservative gravitational force field. For that time interval, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) is assumed (as a first approximation) to be constant.&#x20;
9. The mathematical analysis is limited to the stance phase.
10. During stance phase, the upper body loses height and is simultaneously slowed down. The total mechanical energy of the body decreases from an initial value when it touches down to a minimal value, and increases again towards take off.&#x20;
11. The force, $$F$$, between the foot and the upper body, develops so as to minimize the work it performs in bringing the upper body from touch down to take off. In its mathematical expression, this assumption leads to an open loop optimal control problem.&#x20;
12. The muscles that generate the force, $$F$$, are assumed to be incapable of energy storage. Therefore, the work performed is counted positive for the upper body moving up and down.&#x20;
13. The problem can be solved one dimensionally. The free body diagram for this example is illustrated in Figure 4.2.8.
