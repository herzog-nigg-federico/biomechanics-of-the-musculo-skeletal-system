description: Force of a lateral ligament due to loading.

# Probem 4.2.18 (advanced)

Develop a relatively simple two-dimensional model of the foot to discuss the loading of an idealized lateral ligament (representing all lateral ligaments of the ankle joint complex) during a lateral side-shuffle movement. Determine the force in this idealized lateral ligament as a function of time during ground contact using experimental data from motion analysis, ground reaction forces, and appropriate assumptions.
