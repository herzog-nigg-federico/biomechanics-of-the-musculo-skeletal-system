# Problem 4.2.8

_This problem is a continuation of the model for clumsiness (Problem 4.2.7),as an attempt to improve the initial model so that the results become more relevant for actual high jumping._&#x20;

The small athlete says to a tall one athlete, “It is easy for you to jump high, because your centre of mass is already high at take off”. The tall athlete answers, “No, it is easy for you to jump high, because you need much less force to move your body mass, which is smaller than mine”. Who is right?

#### Assumptions

1. The model of the human body consists of two particles. Half of the body mass is concentrated in the upper particle and the other half in the lower one (Figure 4.2.5 and Figure 4.2.6).
2. The movement analyzed is the vertical jump without a wind-up movement.&#x20;
3.  The body has the ability to pull together its two masses. This assumption is subdivided into two parts:&#x20;

    • One where the time for contraction is not a problem.&#x20;

    • One where the time for contraction is a problem.
4. The length of the body (size) in its starting position is $$75\space \%$$ of its standing length.&#x20;
5.  All the other assumptions that were made for the one particle model are used analogously in this second step.
