# Problem 4.2.7

Develop a model to explain the relationship between body dimensions and the ability to jump.

#### Assumptions

1. Only geometrically similar creatures will be considered.&#x20;
2. The model is restricted to the vertical jump from standing position without wind-up movement.&#x20;
3. The joint angles of the starting position are the same for all similar creatures.&#x20;
4. The muscle force responsible for the movement of the centre of mass can be described by a constant force, $$F$$.&#x20;
5. The human body considered in this context can be described by a particle with the mass, $$m$$.
6.  Symbols:

    $$\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad t \qquad \text{ \space :time}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad a \qquad \text{ :distance which the centre of mass moves upwards during contact with the ground}\\\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F \qquad \text{:average muscle force responsible for movement}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad W \qquad \text{:body weight =}mg \\\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad H \quad \text{\quad  \space :height of flight}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad L \quad \text{\quad \space \space:length (=height) of the body (body size)}\\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad λ \quad \text{\quad \space\space:similarity quotient}$$
7.  ​The comparison of a test body with a general body provides the similarity relations.

    definition:     $$L=\lambda \sdot L_T$$

    length:           $$a=\lambda \sdot a_T$$

    &#x20;                      because of the definition of the similarity quotient.

    force:             $$F=λ^2\sdot f_T$$​

    &#x20;                      because of the general rule that the muscular force increases proportionally with  &#x20;

    &#x20;                      the physiological cross-sectional area of the muscle (which corresponds to the&#x20;

    &#x20;                      second power of the length).

    weight:           $$W=λ^3 \sdot W_T$$

    &#x20;                      because the weight increases proportionally with the volume (which corresponds&#x20;

    &#x20;                      to the third power of the length).​
8.  For the numerical calculations for a test subject (measured in an experiment):

    $$\qquad \qquad a_T=0.2\space m\\ \qquad \qquad L_T=1.6\space m\\\qquad\qquad H_T=0.3\space m$$​
9. The problem can be solved using a one-dimensional approach.

An illustration of the situation and a free body diagram are shown in Figure 4.2.4. The top part illustrates the position of the particle representing the jumper at different times; the bottom part shows the free body diagram.
