# Problem 4.2.12

Develop a model that allows for the determination of factors important for impact forces.

#### Assumptions

1. The problem can be solved two dimensionally.&#x20;
2. The model consists of three rigid segments. Segment 1 corresponds to the leg. Segment 2 corresponds to the thigh. Segment 3 corresponds to the rest of the body.
3. The segments are assumed to have a length, $$L_i$$. The width and depth are assumed to be very small compared to the other geometrical measures.&#x20;
4. The muscle influence is neglected.&#x20;
5. The movement of interest is heel-toe running.&#x20;
6. Running surface, heel pad, and ankle joint are considered one system with a linear spring constant. The spring constant is known.&#x20;
7.  The masses, $$m_i$$, consist of a rigid and a non-rigid part. For this model the rigid masses are assumed to be:

    $$\qquad m_1\space \text{(rigid)} \qquad =0.5\space m\space \text{(leg)}\quad \qquad =50\space \% \space \text{(of the total leg mass)}\\\qquad m_2\space \text{(rigid)} \qquad =0.5\space m\space \text{(thigh)}\qquad =50\space \% \space \text{(of the total thigh mass)}\\\qquad m_3\space \text{(rigid)} \qquad =0.2\space m\space \text{(rest)}\space \space \space\qquad =20\space \% \space \text{(of the total rest mass)}$$
8. â€‹The moments of inertia, $$I_i$$, are known.&#x20;
9. The joints are assumed to be frictionless.
