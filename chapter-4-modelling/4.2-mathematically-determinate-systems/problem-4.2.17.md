# Problem 4.2.17

A runner is contacting the ground with the heel. At the time, $$20\space ms$$ after first ground contact, the ground reaction force is $$F=(-100\space N, 600\space N,0\space N)$$. Determine the force at the hip joint at this time point.

#### Assumptions

1. The hip joint is a hinge joint in the sagittal plane.&#x20;
2. Only one muscle at the posterior side of the hip joint is activated at this time point.&#x20;
3.  The masses of the foot, leg, and thigh are:

    $$m_{foot}=2\space kg,\space m_{leg}=4\space kg,\space m_{thigh}=5\space kg$$â€‹
4.  The coordinates of specific landmarks are:&#x20;
