description: Force at hip joint of a runner.

# Problem 4.2.17

A runner is contacting the ground with the heel. At the time, $$20\space ms$$ after first ground contact, the ground reaction force is $$F=(-100\space N, 600\space N,0\space N)$$. Determine the force at the hip joint at this time point.

#### Assumptions

1. The hip joint is a hinge joint in the sagittal plane.&#x20;
2. Only one muscle at the posterior side of the hip joint is activated at this time point.&#x20;
3.  The masses of the foot, leg, and thigh are:

    $$m_{foot}=2\space kg,\space m_{leg}=4\space kg,\space m_{thigh}=5\space kg$$​
4.  The coordinates of specific landmarks are:

    $$\text{Ankle joint: } A=(-0.00\space m,0.00\space m,0\space m)$$

    $$\text{Knee joint: } K=(-0.10\space m,0.45\space m,0\space m)$$

    $$\text{Hip joint: } H=(-0.30\space m,0.90\space m,0\space m)$$​

    $$\text{Contact point with the ground (heel): } C=(-0.02\space m,-0.12\space m,0\space m)$$

    $$\text{CM (foot): } F=(0.05\space m,-0.06\space m,0\space m)$$

    $$\text{CM (leg): } L=(-0.06\space m,0.25\space m,0\space m)$$​

    $$\text{CM (thigh): } T=(-0.20\space m,0.70\space m,0\space m)$$

    $$\text{Muscle attachment (hip): } M=(-0.30\space m,0.70\space m,0\space m)$$

    ​$$\text{Toe of foot: } P=(0.20\space m,-0.05\space m,0\space m)$$
5. The active muscle crossing the hip joint is attached at point, M, and has a direction which is determined by the vector $$\bold{d}=(-2\space m,5\space m, 0\space m)$$.
6.  The velocities and accelerations at this time are:

    $$\text{Velocity of H, F, L, T } \qquad \space \space \space ν_0=(1\space m/s,-2\space m/s, 0\space m/s)\\\text{Acceleration of H, F, L, T }  \quad a_0=(0\space m/s^2,0\space m/s^2, 0\space m/s^2)$$​
