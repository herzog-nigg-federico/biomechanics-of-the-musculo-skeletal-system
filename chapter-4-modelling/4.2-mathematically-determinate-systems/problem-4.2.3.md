# Problem 4.2.3

Describe the movement of a particle upon which the force of a linear spring is acting.

#### Assumptions

1.  The force of the linear spring is:

    &#x20;$$\newline$$​$$\qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F= -k \sdot x \newline \text{where: }\quad \quad k \text{: spring constant, }x \text{: spring deformation}$$​
2. The mass can be considered as a particle.&#x20;
3. Air resistance can be neglected.&#x20;
4. All forces are drawn in a positive axis direction.
