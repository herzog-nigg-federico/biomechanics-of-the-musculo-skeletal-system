# Problem 4.2.14

A mechanical system with two masses, $$M$$ and $$m$$, is connected by springs and dampers as illustrated in Figure 4.2.14. Derive the equations of motion of the system, and list the required known model parameters and the required initial conditions for determining the movement of the two masses.
