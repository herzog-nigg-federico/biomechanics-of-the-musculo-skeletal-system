# Problem 4.2.15

A particle lands with the contact velocity, $$Î½_0$$, onto the centre of a massless board which is supported by two parallel ideal linear springs, $$k_1$$ and $$k_2$$ (Figure 4.2.15). Determine the position, $$z(t)$$, of the particle for any time after contacting with the massless board.
