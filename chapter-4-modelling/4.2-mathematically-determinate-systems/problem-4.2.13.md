# Problem 4.2.13

Determine the resultant forces and moments at the knee and hip joints when landing on the heel of one foot from a vertical jump (Figure 4.2.11).

#### Assumptions

1. All motion occurs in the sagittal plane.&#x20;
2. The human body is composed of three segments: the shank, which is numbered segment 1, the thigh, which is numbered segment 2, and the trunk, which is numbered segment 3.&#x20;
3. The segments are joined together by frictionless hinge joints.&#x20;
4. Movements of the upper extremities are neglected, and their masses are included in the mass of the trunk.&#x20;
5. All skeletal structures within a segment are modelled as a single rigid body with the geometry of a cylinder with length $$L_{ir}$$, diameter $$d_{ir}$$, and mass $$m_{ir}$$, for $$i=1,2,3$$.
6. The soft tissues or wobbling mass of each segment are modelled as a rigid body with a geometry of a cylinder of length $$L_{iw}$$, diameter $$d_{iw}$$, and mass $$m_{iw}$$, for $$i=1,2,3$$.&#x20;
7. The moment of inertia of each skeletal mass and each soft tissue mass in the plane of motion can be approximated from the length and radius of each cylinder.&#x20;
8. Relative motion between the soft tissues and the skeletal mass of each segment has three degrees of freedom, two translational and one rotational.&#x20;
9. Quasi-elastic, strongly damped forces and moments are associated with relative movement between the soft tissue and skeletal mass of each segment. These forces and moments act at the centres of mass of the soft and skeletal tissues.

The free body diagram for the skeletal segments of the model is shown in Figure 4.2.12.

The free body diagram for the soft tissue segments of the model is shown in Figure 4.2.13.
