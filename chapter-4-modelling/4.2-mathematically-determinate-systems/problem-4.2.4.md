# Problem 4.2.4

Describe the movement of a particle as it drops onto a system of two ideal linear springs. Specifically, answer the following questions:&#x20;

(a) Determine the velocity at contact, $$ν_{crit}$$, for which the first spring bottoms out.&#x20;

(b) Determine the position, $$z(t)$$, of the particle for the two springs.&#x20;

(c) Determine the maximal acceleration (deceleration) of the particle.&#x20;

(d) Draw and discuss the graphs for $$z(t)$$, $$\dot{z}(t)$$, and $$\ddot{z}(t)$$.

#### Assumptions

1. Spring 1 is in contact with the mass. Spring 2 is in contact with spring 1.&#x20;
2. Spring 1 is much softer than spring 2, i.e., $$k_1<<k_2$$ .&#x20;
3. Spring 1 compresses first completely to $$z_b$$ before spring 2 starts to compress.&#x20;
4. Spring 1 remains compressed at position $$z_b$$ while spring 2 is compressed. Consequently, the movement can be subdivided into two parts, a first part for which spring 1 changes length while spring 2 remains at its original length, and a second part for which spring 1 remains compressed at $$z_b$$ while spring 2 changes length. The idealized force-deformation diagram for this case is illustrated in Figure 4.2.1.
5. The forces are drawn in positive axis direction.&#x20;
6.  The two springs are ideal. The force is independent of the velocity, $$ν_o$$. There is no loss of energy.

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F_1=-k_1\sdot z(t) \newline \qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad F_2=-k_2\sdot z(t)$$&#x20;


7. The masses of the springs can be neglected.&#x20;
8.  The numerical values for the problem are:

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad m=4\space kg  \text{\qquad \quad: dropping mass} \newline$$&#x20;

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad z_b=0.04\space m  \text{\space\space\space\space\quad: total compression of spring 1} \newline$$

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad k_1=10^4 \space N/m\text{\quad: spring constant 1} \newline$$

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad k_2=10^6 \space N/m\text{\quad: spring constant 2} \newline$$

    $$\qquad  \qquad \qquad ν_o=4 \space m/s\text{\qquad\space: initial velocity of mass (for question d)} \newline$$
9. Gravity can be neglected.&#x20;
10. The problem can be solved one dimensionally.
