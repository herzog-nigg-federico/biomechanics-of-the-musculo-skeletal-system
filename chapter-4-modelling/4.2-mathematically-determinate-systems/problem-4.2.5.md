description: Movement of a mass dropping onto a system with viscoelastic properties.

# Problem 4.2.5

Experimental measurements from drop tests with a human heel (Nigg & Denoth, 1980; Misevich & Cavanagh, 1984) suggest that the force acting on the heel depends on the deformation $$x(t)$$ and on the velocity of deformation $$\dot{x}(t)$$. The heel pad, therefore, has viscoelastic properties. Determine the movement of a mass (particle) dropping onto a system with viscoelastic properties.

#### Assumptions

1. The human heel has some spring-like behaviour.
2. Friction is involved and, therefore, the loss of energy is not zero. The material exhibits viscoelastic behaviour.
3.  Force: $$\qquad \qquad F(t)=F_{damp}+F_{spring}=-k\sdot x(t)-r\sdot \dot{x} (t)$$​

    This mathematical description of human tissue is simplistic. A more sophisticated approach proposed by Nigg and Denoth (1980) was:

    $$\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad σ(x,\dot{x})=a \sdot x^2+b\sdot x\sdot \dot{x}$$​
4. The problem can be treated one dimensionally.&#x20;
5. The mass is considered as a particle.&#x20;
6. The spring and damping elements are arranged in parallel.&#x20;
7. The forces are drawn in the positive axis direction.
