# Problem 4.2.10

Somersaults are performed in many sport activities, including gymnastics, diving, and ski acrobatics. Coaches and athletes know, based on practical experience, that some rotations are stable and others unstable. In other words, in some types of somersaults it is difficult to maintain the initial rotation around the same axis, while in others it is easy. Lay-out somersaults, for instance, are difficult, but tucked somersaults are easy to balance. Furthermore, the magnitude of the principal moments of inertia play an important role in the stability of a specific rotation. Illustrate with the conservation of energy the fact that some rotations are stable and others unstable.&#x20;

#### Plausibility Conciderations

Consider a rectangular block of a homogeneous material with sides a, b, and c (Figure 4.2.9), and principal axes 1, 2, and 3. This block is thrown into the air, rotating around one of the three principle axes. During the airborne phase only gravity acts on the block, so the angular momentum, H, remains constant. One would, therefore, expect that the rotation, which at the beginning is around one particular principal axis of the rectangular block, should continue around the same principal axis during the whole airborne phase. These expectations can be experimentally verified for rotations around axes 1 and 3, the axes with the maximal (3) and minimal (1) values for the principal moments of inertia. However, rotations that start around axis 2, the axis with the median value for the principal moment of inertia, are unstable, and the block starts to twist and tilt (Nigg, 1974).

#### Assumptions

1. Homogeneous rigid rectangular block.&#x20;
2. No air resistance.
3. $$a>b>c$$â€‹
4. $$I_{11}<I_{22}<I_{33}$$
