# Problem 4.2.11

Determine the movement (position, velocity, and acceleration) of an idealized arm with no muscle influence in the horizontal plane.

#### Assumptions

1. The elbow and shoulder are ideal hinge joints with no friction.&#x20;
2. The shoulder joint is fixed in space.&#x20;
3. The muscular influence is neglected.&#x20;
4. The anthropometrical information with respect to length, moments of inertia, and masses are known.&#x20;
5. The initial conditions for the angular position, $$φ_i(0)$$, and the angular velocity, $$\dot{φ}_i(0)$$, are known.&#x20;
6. The problem can be solved two-dimensionally.

The illustration of the situation and the free body diagrams are given in Figure 4.2.10.
