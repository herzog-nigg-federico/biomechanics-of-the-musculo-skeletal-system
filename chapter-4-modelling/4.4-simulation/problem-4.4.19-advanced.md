# Problem 4.4.19 (advanced)

Consider the problem of maximal-distance ski jumping. Assume that the athlete can influence lift, drag, and pitching moment continuously by changing joint angles. Choose a suitable parameterization to find the optimal strategy during flight, assuming constant initial conditions. Solve the problem using typical aerodynamic data from the literature.
