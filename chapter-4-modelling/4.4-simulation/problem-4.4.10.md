# Problem 4.4.10

(a) In the simulation of the downhill coasting cyclist (Listing 1), determine which value of the step size $$h$$ is required to get at most a $$5\space\%$$ error in the speed of the cyclist at any given time.

(b) Modify the simulation program in Listing 1 the propulsive force due to pedaling. Consider different ways to model this:&#x20;

1. Constant force.
2. Constant power.

(c) Modify the program in Listing 1 to compute $$x$$, the distance traveled by the cyclist, by including the ODE $$\dot{x}=Î½$$ in the model. Then include the effect of change of altitude on the air drag coefficient $$k$$.
