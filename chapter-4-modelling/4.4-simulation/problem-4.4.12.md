  Simulation program modification (maximally activated muscle undergoing a ramp
  shortening protocol).

# Problem 4.4.12

Modify the program in Listing 3 to include the eccentric part of the force-velocity relationship, i.e., $$F>F_0$$. Develop a suitable mathematical model from the following information.

(a) The force-velocity relationship must be continuous at zero velocity.&#x20;

(b) At high eccentric velocities, the muscle force approaches 1.5 asymptotically. Use the modified program to simulate isokinetic lengthening protocols.
