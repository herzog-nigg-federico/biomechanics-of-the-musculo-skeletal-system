description: Simulations for determination of optimal quadriceps moment arm.

# Problem 4.4.14

Imagine an unloaded knee extension task with the object of hitting a target with maximal foot velocity. Assume that the target is always reached at full knee extension, and use a series of simulations to determine the optimal quadriceps moment arm for this task. How does this optimal moment arm compare to actual moment arms reported in the literature (Visser et al., 1991)?
