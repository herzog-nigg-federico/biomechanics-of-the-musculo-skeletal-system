description: Simulation of the pitching moment in a javelin.

# Problem 4.4.16

(a) In a real javelin, the pitching moment is a complex function of the angle of attack (Hubbard & Rust, 1984). Incorporate such a function in the simulation and examine the behaviour of the model.

(b) Modify the program in Listing 5 by adding commands to draw the javelin as a line element on the screen after each forward Euler step. Examine the difference between optimal and non-optimal flight trajectories. After the simulation, examine the orientation of the javelin to see if the throw was legal (tip-first landing).

(c) Add the effect of wind to the simulation of javelin flight. How should the release strategy be modified by the athlete in the presence of wind?
