# Problem 4.4.11

(a) Modify the equations of motion for arm movement, and the simulation model (Listing 2) to include constant joint torques at both joints.

(b) Modify the equations of motion for arm movement, and the simulation model (Listing 2) to simulate movement in a vertical plane by including gravitational forces. Simulate this two-segment pendulum. What is different, compared to the simulated movement in the horizontal plane?
