# Problem 4.1.5

Assume that the agreement between theoretically predicted results from a specific model and experimentally determined results is in the range of $$\pm5\space \%$$. Comment on: (a) the appropriateness, and (b) the validity of the model to predict these results if you are interested in predicting a result with an accuracy of $$10 \space \%$$.
