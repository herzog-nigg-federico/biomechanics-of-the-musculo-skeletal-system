# Problem 4.3.4 (advanced)

Calculate analytically the force-sharing expression between three muscles in a two-joint system. Muscles 1 and 2 cross both joints and muscle 3 crosses only one joint. Use the cost function of Crowninshield and Brand (1981b), and assume that muscle forces are equal or greater than zero, that is:

Cost function:

Minimize $$φ$$​, where: $$\qquad φ= \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^3(F_i^m/pcsa_i)^3$$​

Subject to constraints:

$$\qquad h_1: \quad F_i^m\ge0\quad \text{for } i=1,2,3\\\qquad h_2: \quad M_1=r_1\sdot F_1^m+r_2\sdot F_2^m+r_3\sdot F_3^m\\ \qquad h_3: \quad M_2=r_4\sdot F_1^m + r_5\sdot F_2^m$$​

where:

$$\qquad F_i^m \text{\qquad\qquad \qquad is the force in the }i^{th} \text{ muscle}\\\qquad pcsa_i \text{\qquad \qquad \quad \space is the }i^{th} \text{ physiological cross-sectional area}\\\qquad r_i\space (i=1,5) \text{\qquad \space \space are the moment arms of the three muscles about the two joints}$$​
