# Problem 4.3.2

Assuming that the system of interest is a one-joint, planar system in which the joint of interest is crossed by two agonistic muscles, calculate the force-sharing between these two muscles; i.e., express the force in muscle 1, $$F_1$$, as a function of the force in muscle 2, $$F_2$$.&#x20;

Therefore, minimize:

$$\qquad \phi = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^2(F_i/pcsa_i)^3$$

subject to:

$$\qquad M_o=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^2(r_{i/0}\sdot F_i)$$â€‹
