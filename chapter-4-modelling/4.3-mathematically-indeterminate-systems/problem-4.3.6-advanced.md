# Problem 4.3.6 (advanced)

Use the planar, two degrees of freedom model with four one-joint and two two-joint muscles as shown below (Figure 4.3.2). Show analytically that there are static situations for which co-contraction of the two two-joint muscles (muscles 5 and 6, Figure 4.3.2) is required to obtain a minimum stress solution as formulated by Crowninshield and Brand (1981b) (see [problem-4.2.19-advanced.md](../4.2-mathematically-determinate-systems/problem-4.2.19-advanced.md "mention")).

Note that one possible way of solving this problem is given by Herzog and Binding (1993).
