# Problem 4.3.5 (advanced)

Use the planar, three degrees of freedom model with six one-joint and four two-joint muscles as shown below (Figure 4.3.1), and show analytically that there are static situations for which one-joint antagonistic muscle activity is required to produce a minimum stress solution as formulated by Crowninshield and Brand (1981b), that is:

Minimize $$φ$$​, where: $$\qquad φ= \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10}(\frac{F_i}{pcsa_i})^3$$

where:

​$$\qquad F_i^m \text{\qquad\qquad \qquad is the force in the }i^{th} \text{ muscle}\\\qquad pcsa_i \text{\qquad \qquad \quad \space is the }i^{th} \text{ physiological cross-sectional area}$$

The constraints of the problem are that all three joint moments are satisfied by the moments produced by the muscle forces and that all muscle forces are tensile, i.e., $$F_i\ge 0$$.&#x20;

Note, one possible way of solving this problem is given by Herzog and Binding (1992).&#x20;

Antagonistic muscular activity is defined by $$\bold{m_i}\sdot\bold{M_j}<0$$, where $$m_i$$ is the moment produced by the $$i^{th}$$ muscle, is the resultant moment at the $$j^{th}$$ joint, and $$\sdot$$ represents the vector dot product.

The joints are planar hinge joints that are crossed by a pair of one-joint muscles on either side, i.e., a one-joint flexor and extensor muscle. The joints are also crossed by two (distal and proximal), and four (middle) two-joint muscles, as shown.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Problem 4.3.5.JPG>)
